>> RUTH JOHN: Hello!
>> AUDIENCE: Hello!

>> RJ: Hello Brazil!

My name is Ruth.

You can find me all over the Internet as
@Rumyra, that's Twitter, GitHub, CodePen,

whatever your flavor.

There's a whole theory on the speaker
circle about how you follow Jake Archibald

during a talk like that, that was an
incredible talk.

And I don't have a Game of Thrones opening.

[Laughter]

So, this is the second time, I'm sure,
I have to follow him as well.

So, rule number one: start with
Game of Thrones, I don't have that.

Rule number two: don't talk about web.

Haha.

There is gonna be web, don't worry,
[INAUDIBLE].

I'm gonna talk to you all about MIDI,
which seems like a very strange topic.

But bear with me.

Now, there is a reason I want to talk to
you about MIDI.

That's because there's a common
misconception about MIDI,

and it goes a little something about this.

[8-bit music plays]

Right.

[INAUDIBLE]

[Music ends]

That's a real website by the way.

That's a modern website, [INAUDIBLE]
well done.

I recommend you all to [INAUDIBLE], it's
amazing!

That music that you heard...

that's not MIDI.

That's digital audio.

Right, those bleeping noises...

whenever you say the word MIDI,
people think of those bleeping noises.

There's a good reason for that.

That's because MIDI stands for
Musical Instrument Digital Interface.

Right?

So people sort of get hung up on this
Musical Instrument bit,

and I will touch on musical instruments a
bit later, so you'll understand why.

But the real interesting thing about MIDI...

is Digital Interface.

And that's what I want to talk to you
about today.

MIDI came around after a rise in the
popularity of digital instruments

in the 70s.

And so, they had a bunch of industry
experts come together, so people who were

building musical instruments, musicians,

everybody like that, so they came together
in the early 80s.

And they thought to themselves, "Wouldn't
it be nice if all these instruments

had a protocol so they could talk to each
other, like, all the same".

Right?

So, in 1993, they created...

MIDI specification.

And at the time it was General MIDI 1.

Now, there's lots of MIDI specifications
today and I'm gonna take you through

some of them.

But if we start with General MIDI 1.

General MIDI 1 was made of three main parts.

There was the actual digital specification,
and this is messages that were sent

back and forth from all these sort of
digital instruments that they had.

There was a file format.

Now, this doesn't really stand as a file
format so much today,

this is usually part of other file formats.

I'm not gonna talk to you about it, if you
want to find out more about it,

I'm sure you can find out more about it on
the Internet.

And there was a connector specification.

I'm sure you've all seen it, this is a sort of [INAUDIBLE] connector, with sort of five pins in it.

And you usually use to find it on the back of some cards, you can find it on older digital instruments.

This has sort of been superseded by [INAUDIBLE], I will touch on it a bit later.
